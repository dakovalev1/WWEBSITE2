title: Accelerated Variance-Reduced Methods for Saddle-Point Problems
abstract: We consider composite minimax optimization problems where the goal is to find a saddle-point of a large sum of non-bilinear objective functions augmented by simple composite regularizers for the primal and dual variables. For such problems, under the average-smoothness assumption, we propose accelerated stochastic variance-reduced algorithms with optimal up to logarithmic factors complexity bounds. In particular, we consider strongly-convex-strongly-concave, convex-strongly-concave, and convex-concave objectives. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first nearly-optimal algorithms for this setting.
