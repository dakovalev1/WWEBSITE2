title: Decentralized Optimization over Time-varying Graphs: a Survey
abstract: Decentralized optimization over time-varying networks has a wide range of applications in distributed learning, signal processing and various distributed control problems. The agents of the distributed system locally hold optimization objectives and can communicate to their immediate neighbors over a network that changes from time to time. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art results and describe the techniques for optimization over time-varying graphs. We also give an overview of open questions in the field and formulate hypotheses and directions for future work.
