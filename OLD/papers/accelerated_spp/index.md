title: Accelerated methods for composite non-bilinear saddle point problem
abstract: Based on G. Lan's accelerated gradient sliding and general relation between the smoothness and strong convexity parameters of function under Legendre transformation we show that under rather general conditions the best known bounds for bilinear convex-concave smooth composite saddle point problem keep true for or non-bilinear convex-concave smooth composite saddle point problem. Moreover, we describe situations when the bounds differ and explain the nature of the difference.
