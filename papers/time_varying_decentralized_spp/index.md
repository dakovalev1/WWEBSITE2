title: Optimal Decentralized Algorithms for Saddle Point Problems over Time-Varying Networks
date: 13 July, 2021
abstract: Decentralized optimization methods have been in the focus of optimization community due to their scalability, increasing popularity of parallel algorithms and many applications. In this work, we study saddle point problems of sum type, where the summands are held by separate computational entities connected by a network. The network topology may change from time to time, which models real-world network malfunctions. We obtain lower complexity bounds for algorithms in this setup and develop optimal methods which meet the lower bounds.
